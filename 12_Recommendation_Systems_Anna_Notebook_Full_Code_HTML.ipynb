We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.\n","\n","--------------\n","## **Context:**\n","--------------\n","\n","Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial.\n","\n","*In this context, “turning to denial” refers to a psychological phenomenon where consumers might feel overwhelmed by the abundance of options available, leading them to avoid making a decision altogether. When faced with too many choices, some people experience “choice overload,” which can result in them either delaying a purchase, sticking to familiar products, or not buying anything at all.*\n","\n","Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business.\n","\n","E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n","\n","Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n","\n","----------------\n","## **Objective:**\n","----------------\n","\n","You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n","\n","-----------------------------\n","## **Dataset:**\n","-----------------------------\n","\n","The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n","\n","- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n","- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n","- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n","- **timestamp:** Time of the rating.

Ratings below 3 are usually considered negative or neutral, while ratings above 3 tend to be more positive.\n","  - By setting the threshold at 3.5, you’re ensuring that only ratings that are distinctly positive (e.g., 4 or 5) are classified as relevant.\n","  - This approach helps to avoid ambiguity: a rating of 3 might mean “okay” or “neutral,” but 4 and 5 typically mean “liked” or “loved.”\n","- Avoiding False Positives:\n","  - A higher threshold (like 3.5) helps to ensure that recommended items are genuinely relevant.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hpu_za_Hmzci"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The KNNBasic model we've built is primarily a user-based collaborative filtering model, and here’s how it functions:\n","\n","User-Based Collaborative Filtering:\n","- K-Neighbors Approach:\n","  - The model identifies a user’s k-nearest neighbors (users who have similar preferences or behaviors) based on the cosine similarity of their rating patterns. For example, if User A and User B have rated several of the same products similarly, they are considered similar (or “neighbors”).\n","  - Once the model finds the k-nearest neighbors for a given user, it predicts ratings for items by aggregating the ratings of these similar users.\n","  - If many similar users have liked (rated highly) a product that the target user hasn’t interacted with, the model will recommend that product.\n","    - This is what makes it collaborative: it learns from the collective behavior of users to make predictions and recommendations.\n","\n","Observations:\n","- High Precision@10 (0.855):\n","  - A Precision@10 of 0.855 means that 85% of the top 10 recommended items are actually relevant to the users. This is a strong result, indicating that the model is very good at recommending products that users are likely to find useful or enjoyable.\n","  - High precision is important because it minimizes false positives, meaning users won’t be shown items that they aren’t interested in. This leads to better user experiences and higher engagement.\n","- High Recall@10 (0.856):\n","  - A Recall@10 of 0.856 means that 85.4% of all relevant items are being correctly identified and recommended by the model.\n","  - High recall suggests that the model is effectively capturing a wide range of items that users would find relevant, helping to ensure that they don’t miss out on potential products they might like.\n","- Balanced F1-Score@10 (0.855):\n","  - The F1-Score@10 of 0.855 is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving a balanced view of the model’s overall performance. Since F1-Score considers both precision and recall, this high score indicates that the model strikes a good balance between recommending relevant items and covering a wide range of preferences.\n","- The close values of precision and recall suggest that the model is neither too conservative (only recommending a few highly likely items) nor too broad (recommending many items, some of which might not be relevant).\n","\n","Real-World Applicability: These scores suggest that the tuned KNNBasic model can deliver reliable recommendations in a real-world setting, where the balance between not overwhelming users (high precision) and not missing potential interests (high recall) is key."],"metadata":{"id":"8Aq_BR5VoSC3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YhcAXK0CnVNG"},"source":["### **Steps:**\n","- **Predict rating for the user with `userId=\"A3LDPF5FMB782Z\"`, and `prod_id= \"1400501466\"` using the optimized model**\n","- **Predict rating for `userId=\"A34BZM6S9L7QI4\"` who has not interacted with `prod_id =\"1400501466\"`, by using the optimized model**\n","- **Compare the output with the output from the baseline model**"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Using sim_user_user_optimized model to recommend for userId \"A3LDPF5FMB782Z\" and productId 1400501466\n","# Defining the user ID and product ID\n","user_id = \"A3LDPF5FMB782Z\"\n","product_id = \"1400501466\"\n","\n","# Using the predict method from the optimized KNN model to predict the rating\n","predicted_rating = final_knn_model.predict(uid=user_id, iid=product_id)\n","\n","# Displaying the predicted rating and other details\n","print(f\"Predicted rating for user {user_id} and product {product_id}: {predicted_rating.est}\")\n","print(f\"Details: {predicted_rating}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Q8-8wBJgrn06","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729458979828,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":209,"user":{"displayName":"ANNA LAPUSHNER","userId":"11858468224605250827"}},"outputId":"5af987ae-ed91-43fa-9b34-f3356d23b8f1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Predicted rating for user A3LDPF5FMB782Z and product 1400501466: 4.291134845916638\n","Details: user: A3LDPF5FMB782Z item: 1400501466 r_ui = None   est = 4.29   {'was_impossible': True, 'reason': 'Not enough neighbors.'}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Observations:\n","\n","The optimized model has predicted for user A3LDPF5FMB782Z a rating for product 1400501466 of 4.29.
